# Jiter-Pupy Comprehensive Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the jiter-pupy codebase, focusing on stability, elegance, and deployability. The plan addresses technical debt, performance optimizations, enhanced testing, and improved user experience while maintaining full API compatibility with the original Rust-based jiter library.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Pure Python Implementation**: Successfully provides a drop-in replacement for jiter without requiring Rust compilation
2. **API Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with the original jiter interface
3. **Feature Complete**: Implements all major features including string caching, float handling modes, partial parsing, and duplicate key detection
4. **Good Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage examples
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deployment

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Version Management**: Import errors in mobile environments (jiter.__version__ module not found)
2. **String Caching Limitations**: Current implementation has inefficiencies due to json.JSONDecoder limitations
3. **LosslessFloat Implementation**: Cannot achieve true byte-level preservation with standard library
4. **Error Handling**: Line/column information for duplicate keys is imprecise
5. **Test Coverage**: Needs more edge case testing and benchmarking
6. **Performance**: Pure Python implementation is inherently slower than Rust
7. **Partial Parsing**: "trailing-strings" mode has limitations with json.loads

## Improvement Objectives

1. **Enhanced Stability**: Fix all known bugs and improve error handling
2. **Improved Performance**: Optimize critical paths without sacrificing correctness
3. **Better Deployment**: Ensure smooth installation and usage across all environments
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Achieve >95% test coverage with extensive edge case testing
5. **User Experience**: Improve error messages and add helpful debugging features
6. **Future-Proofing**: Design for extensibility and maintainability
